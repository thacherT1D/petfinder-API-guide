# Using the Petfinder API

Documenting my use of the Petfinder API in a basic React JS application

### Getting Started

A Petfinder account is required to get a developer key -- you can also find the API documentation [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key)

Need to catch up on APIs? Check these out for a primer on [Using Postman](https://github.com/thacherT1D/APICallsUsingPostman_PokemonAPI) and [Using Postmant for API GET calls with Developer Keys](https://github.com/thacherT1D/APICallsUsingPostman_wDeveloperKeys_MarvelAPI/blob/master/README.md)
